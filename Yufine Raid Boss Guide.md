# Intro
Are you tired of spending weeks 100%-ing normal labs? Are you tired of optimizing 40-44 morale Hell Raid teams that trudge through both bosses and soon 5 whole fricking bosses, all the while optimizing for each? That's insane, I'm insane ![MutsukiCurse](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559988477991583747/627001616943546368/MutsukiYou.png) So for the insane people like me or Oklo [who spends 3 hours to farm 1k+ ancient coins in lab 3-2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618249387822546975/627261082716602368/Screenshot_2019-09-27-14-33-43.png), I present to you a guide to raid boss **"best girl Yufine"** <sub> ~~- Dimbreath~~ </sub> . I'm also stupid for writing this guide. And tbh, you are right, SG will prolly "bug fix" this like how they fucked over Sez as soon as 5 bosses Hell Raid hit, but until they do. **THIS IS A FEATURE**, I repeat, 
#### **_This is not a bug, an exploit or anything that game breaking, this is a perfectly intended game interaction by the devs. /s_** 

<sub> Regretting skipping that Yufine banner now? ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559988477991583747/627330575581315090/SmugBucky.png) </sub>

> P.S: Oh btw, this is not a PvP guide, although you can run basically the same shit in PvP and feed all the fights but don't let me stop you (well cause there's no -90% speed on your raid boss to counter enough times to extend buffs and Basars have like 125% Eff even while on 250 speed). 

**Legacy:** here for convenience (pretty common terms but you'll never know)
- ER = Effect Resistance (the stat that let you resist more than just RNG 15%)
- Eff = Effectiveness (the stat let your debuffs not get resisted more than 15% of the time)
- EE = Exclusive Equipment (A type of unit gears equippable only when 5 stars awakened on a small hexagon next to the artifact slot which is only obtainable through side story or Hall of Trials exchange shop)
- ML = Moonlight (Referring to the Moonlight Shade version of a character, e.g: Apocalypse Ravi is the Moonlight Shade version of Fire Ravi hence ML Ravi or ARavi, Crescent Moon Rin is ML Rin)
## Important note on stat stacking: passives, buffs, debuffs, artifacts and morale impacts are all additive to each other and are added on top of the character sheet stats. Therefore Sigurd Scythe is a direct damage increase that negates the effect of morale when used with ML Achates. And speed buff from Yufine's S2 is your greatest enemy.

# Essential Components

## ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/yufine/small.png) **[Best girl Yufine](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/yufine)** ~~_Obviously_~~

#### Even best girl needs gears if you want her to be an actual raid boss, the requirement is actually quite simple:
 - **A Counter set farmed from her nuking B11 or poverty gears from secret shop** ~~unless you galaxy bren with ML Rin and steal a counter buff somewhere~~
 - **Her unique EE with the 1st skill of "35% chance on using Double Slash to extend all buffs duration by 1 turn" (The Eff roll is irrelevant most of the time so don't fuss over it rolling anything less than 16%)**
 - **Either make sure she has enough ER to resist all debuffs or you are sure her buffs aren't getting dispelled (Yes, you can resist dispels like all other debuffs)**

In the context of this exclusively PvE guide, we will not touch on PvP Eff. So how much ER does your Yufine needs, well it depends on the situation, _generally_, and very generally, PvE mobs will have the same Eff as their ER. A safe spot to aim for is 
- 170-175% is just for end-game stuffs where stuffs have 70-75% ER
- 150% for Hell Raid elites and Nixied Sanctum
- 125% for Normal Raid and other content
> **TL;DR: enemy ER + 100% is your desired ER number after all imprints and gears + artifact**

Other desirable stats on your Raid boss include:
- **LOW SPEED:** Like actually base speed, ideally you don't want to go above 140 speed generally and you want as low as possible to preserve your buffs and proc more counter to extend them (Don't buff speed, never use S2, I'm in the process of testing no morale solo Hell Kark fight, which I'm pretty sure you can RNG counter to dispel his stealth or wait till reflect do more than enough damage rather than using S2 to dispel it)
- Attack
- Crit (both chance and damage) -> you can go 30% crit chance and have crit buff + arky buff to get 100% crit chance

#### Artifacts: Now this is where it gets contentious but it mostly comes down to your gears and teams:
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/strak-gauntlet/icon.png) **[Strak's Gauntlet](https://epicsevendb.com/artifact/els-fist):** well 30-60% ER cuts down your gear requirement greatly so people like this (Doesn't work as well with SSAcha cause Immortality)
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/sigurd-scythe/icon.png) **[Sigurd Scythe](https://epicsevendb.com/artifact/sigurd-scythe):** This only works with SSAcha's immortality and its attack buff is addictive to morale so you would have 35% attack instead of 10% at -50 morale
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/els-fist/icon.png) **[El's Fist](https://epicsevendb.com/artifact/els-fist):** Ok, this mostly doesn't work cause speed buff from this is addictive to morale so you would be having 60% speed and not 10% at -50 morale, but you can have counter buff somewhere and it still can work, maybe, still steer clear of it is my opinion

## **Primary Buffer: An Invincible/Immortal buff** 
#### Your choices on this is limited and they all do the same thing so just pick one that you have (SSAcha is the best imo)

<br/>

### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/ruele-of-light/small.png) **[Ruele of Light](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/ruele-of-light)**
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/shooting-star-achates/small.png) **[Shooting Star Achates](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/shooting-star-achates): Has ER Imprints and her buff last 3 turns requiring less RNG when starting**

### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/crimson-armin/small.png) **[Crimson Armin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crimson-armin): Has ER Imprints**
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/blaze-dingo/small.png) **[Blaze Dingo](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/blaze-dingo): Has attack buff**
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/achates/small.png) **[Achates](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/achates)**
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin/small.png) **[Crescent Moon Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin): Steal buffs but don't have innate Invincibility/Immortality**
#### **Important Note**: Imprints last even if the unit granting it dies so SSAcha and CArmin is very nice to lessen the gear requirement. Also ML Rin don't have innate Invincibility/Immortality buff but rather depends on the enemies having them for her to steal which is really rare and situational so she might not even be here but I would be on a stake if I don't put her here.

# Complementary Components:
Ok now that your team has 2 units: Yufine and your buffer slave, what more do you want? Well more buffs always help which I will seperate by order of usefulness as well as more imprints (except speed). Sadly all the other ER imprints are non-buffers so body drag time (I guess I should put a throwaway note listing them here: [Fallen Cecilia](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/fallen-cecilia), [Maid Chloe](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/maid-chloe), [Fighter Maya](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/fighter-maya), [Angelica](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/angelica), [Crozet](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crozet))
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_reflect.png)Reflect: (a.k.a Dominiel is 2nd best girl, it's canon now)
#### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/dominiel/small.png)[Dominiel](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/dominiel): Remember me?
> This buff reflect back 30% of the damage your raid boss (should) have taken after defense calculation back to the attacker ignoring their defense all the while. Ok, let's be real, you aren't going to do consistent damage relying on counter so this buff granted by Ice Dominiel (not the Mola eating, crit buffing, oneshotting legend Dodomi but the forgotten Dominiel Nixied) is gonna be the most sure-fire way to get more damage.
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_counter.png)Counter: [ML Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin) exclusive steal
> This buff makes the buffed target has 100% counter chance upon being hit. It sounds so good, what's the catch? Well, you just have to search out a counterattack mini-boss, proc it and let [ML Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin) steals the buff for your raid boss. Seems straight forward enough if it wasn't gated to that 2nd mini-boss fight on the Hell Kark side and somewhere in normal raid.
### ![](https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/guardians-blessing.png)Guardians Blessing: Colloquially known as Arky's buff
> Well this one is straight forward enough no? Practically a free 20% attack and crit chance buff, only downside is spending 30 soul (charges) using the literal best dps Guardian available: **Fluffly Arky**
### List of Offensive buffs: ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cridmg_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cri_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up2.png)
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cridmg_up.png) **Crit damage buff** (which buff crit damage by a flat 50%) is only granted by [ML Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin) to herself so it's pretty irrelevant unless you can find a mob that steals that buff from you for you to steal back or a mob that has it (I can't remember any that has that buff tho, but if you do inform me) ~~Included for consistency sake~~
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cri_up.png) **Crit rate buff** (which buff crit chance by a flat 50%) is granted by a couple of people: [Furious](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/furious), [Tywin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/tywin), [Challenger Dominiel](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/challenger-dominiel), and ofc the buff stealer [ML Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin) 
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up2.png) **Greater attack buff** (which buff attack by 75% and overwrites normal Attack buff) granted by [Yuna](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/yuna) through her EE at a 30% chance
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up.png) **Attack buff** (which buff attack by 50%) is one of the most accessible buff in the game, finding one shouldn't be that hard

# Building Specific Comps
So far I have theorycrafted/field tested 3 comps that I'm sure that works which I'll detail below
- Basic, little to no gear requirement: reflect comp
- High end-gear requirement with proper understanding of the map characteristics: damage counter comps
- Galaxy bren ML Rin comp
<br/>
### Reflect Comp:
#### Pros:
> Consistent
> Low gear investment and easy to execute
> Work wonderfully in Raids but not in normal Labs
#### Cons:
> RNG only in the 1st part if your Invul buffer is 1 turn and you need to extend it
> Easiest to get stuck in an infinite loop with non-damage-stacking life steal/shielding mini-bosses
> Slowest of them all

Well as the name suggest, you just need the bare basic here, 150% ER or at most 175% ER, not that hard if you are running ER ring and Strak, the core of this comp, outside of Yufine obviously, is as you might expect, Dominiel. She's the only reflect buffer in the game and with it, your damage is guaranteed in both normal raid and Hell Raid. Once it's up and running, you just need to tab back in every 15-20 minutes to move. You can also use this comp for dog walking as well since you only using 3 units: Yufine, Dominiel and your Primary buffer. It's consistent and most useful in Raids since there's no life stealing mini-bosses there
<br/>
### Damage Counter Comp:
#### Pros:
> Fast run
> Works great for all type of Labs and Raids
> Flexible team comp (Can dog walk)
> Can kill life steal/shield mini-boss road block
### Cons:
> Required specific damage tuning to keep buffs up 
> Higher gear requirement
> **Need to remember to use Arky**
This is the cookie cutter, most commonly used comp to farm ancient coins/gold from normal labs. This is where SSAcha shines as the best Primary buffer with her synergy with Sigurd Scythe buffing 25% attack on Yufine. Best used buffers are Yuna (greater attack buff), Blaze Dingo (Invul + Attack), and Tywin (Attack + Crit chance). The core of this comp is buffing with **Arky buff**, Attack buff and with SSAcha, Sigurd Scythe to counteract the morale debuff giving your Yufine her damage back. the math is as followed:
> 20% (Arky) + 50/75% (Attack buff) + 25% (Sigurd) - 90% (morale) = -20% to +20% attack debuff/buff
There's no ideal attack % buff, sometimes you might want more, sometimes you might want less, you need to fine tune Yufine damage so she don't kill mobs too fast else the buffs might elapsed on an unlucky no counter/extension streak. 
<br/>
### ML Rin Comp:
#### Pros:
> Sanic Speed Run even at -50 morale
> Super consistent and will never fail (unless you fail 35% proc 10 times in a row), can solo 4/5 bosses in normal raids and do everything in Hell raid available
#### Cons:
> Specific unit required: ML Rin (an ML nat4 that most people benched)
> Specific lab/raid pathing and can't be executed if the condition is not met (RNG Counter mini-boss in lab is RNG)
> **Need to remember to use Arky**
> Yufine's stat also need to be mixed and matched to make sure she can attack enough times to extend the buffs (albeit a bit irrelevant unless you are extrememly unlucky to miss 35% 10 times in a row). 
This is the hardest comp to execute but it's also the fastest while being the most consistent. The star of the show here is the [counter buff](Yufine%20Raid%20Boss%20Guide.md#counter-ml-rin-exclusive-steal) which can only be obtained by stealing it from a counterattacking mini-boss (most notably 2nd miniboss on Hell Kark side) else everything is straight forward, stack as much damage buffs, etc etc. Since your Yufine is countering every attack, counter set is not even needed in this comp and you can safely go resist or attack/destruction/crit sets instead. **P.S: REMEMBER ARKY BUFF**

# TL;DR: Yufine with A LOT of ER (170% is safe) with a [immunity/immortality buffer](Yufine%20Raid%20Boss%20Guide.md#an-invincibleimmortal-buffer) and complementary buffers [(Ice Dominiel is bae)](Yufine%20Raid%20Boss%20Guide.md#reflect-aka-dominiel-is-2nd-best-girl-its-canon-now)
