# Intro
Are you tired of spending weeks 100%-ing normal labs? Are you tired of optimizing 40-44 morale Hell Raid teams that trudge through both bosses and soon 5 whole fricking bosses, all the while optimizing for each? That's insane, I'm insane ![MutsukiCurse](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559988477991583747/627001616943546368/MutsukiYou.png) for spending hours each weeks to do not do that and run **"best girl Yufine"** <sup> - Dimbreath </sup> instead. I'm also stupid for writing this guide. And tbh, you are right, SG will prolly "bug fix" this like how they fucked over Sez as soon as 5 bosses Hell Raid hit, but until they do. **THIS IS A FEATURE**, I repeat, 
#### **_This is not a bug, an exploit or anything that game breaking, this is a perfectly intended game interaction by the devs. /s_** 

<br/><br/>

> P.S: Oh btw, this is not a PvP guide, although you can run basically the same shit in PvP and prolly will win/feed all the fights but don't count on it (well cause there's no -90% speed on your raid boss to counter enough times to extend buffs and Basars have like 125% Eff even while on 250 speed). 

Legacy here too for convenience (pretty common terms but you'll never know)
- ER = Effect Resistance (the stat that let you resist more than just RNG 15%)
- Eff = Effectiveness (the stat let your debuffs not get resisted more than 15% of the time)
- EE = Exclusive Equipment (A type of unit gears equippable only when 5 stars awakened on a small hexagon next to the artifact slot which is only obtainable through side story or Hall of Trials exchange shop)
- ML = Moonlight (Referring to the Moonlight Shade version of a character, e.g: Apocalypse Ravi is the Moonlight Shade version of Fire Ravi hence ML Ravi or ARavi, Crescent Moon Rin is ML Rin)

# Essential Components

## ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/yufine/small.png)**Best girl Yufine** ~~_Obviously_~~

#### Even best girl needs gear if you want her to be an actual raid boss, the requirement is actually quite simple:
 - **A Counter set farmed from her nuking B11 or poverty gears from secret shop** ~~unless you galaxy bren with ML Rin and steal a counter buff somewhere~~
 - **Her unique EE with the 1st skill of "30% chance on using Double Slash to extend all buffs duration by 1 turn" (The Eff roll is irrelevant most of the time so don't fuss over it rolling anything less than 16%)**
 - **Either make sure she has enough ER to resist all debuffs or you are sure her buffs aren't getting dispelled (Yes, you can resist dispels like all other debuffs)**

In the context of this exclusively PvE guide, we will not touch on PvP Eff. So how much ER does your Yufine needs, well it depends on the situation, _generally_, and very generally, PvE mobs will have the same Eff as their ER. A safe spot to aim for is 
- 170-175% is just for end-game stuffs where stuffs have 70-75% ER
- 150% for Hell Raid elites and Nixied Sanctum
- 125% for Normal Raid and other content
> **TL;DR: enemy ER + 100% is your desired ER number after all imprints and gears + artifact**

Other desirable stats on your Raid boss include: (but you know this already)
- Attack
- Crit (both chance and damage)

#### Artifacts: Now this is where it gets contentious but it mostly comes down to your gears and teams:
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/strak-gauntlet/icon.png) **Strak's Gauntlet:** well 30-60% ER cuts down your gear requirement greatly so people like this (Doesn't work as well with SSAcha cause Immortality)
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/sigurd-scythe/icon.png) **Sigurd Scythe:** This only works with SSAcha's immortality and its attack buff is addictive to morale so you would have 35% attack instead of 10% at -50 morale
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/artifact/els-fist/icon.png) **El's Fist:** Ok, this mostly doesn't work cause speed buff from this is addictive to morale so you would be having 60% speed and not 10% at -50 morale, but you can have counter buff somewhere and it still can work, maybe, still steer clear of it is my opinion

## **An Invincible/Immortal buffer:** 
#### Your choices on this is limited and they all do the same thing so just pick one that you have

### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/crimson-armin/small.png) **[Crimson Armin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crimson-armin): Has ER Imprints**
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/blaze-dingo/small.png) **[Blaze Dingo](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/blaze-dingo): Has attack buffs**

### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin/small.png) **[Crescent Moon Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin): Steal buffs but don't have innate Invincibility/Immortality**
#### **Important Note**: Imprints last even if the unit granting it dies so SSAcha and CArmin is very nice to lessen the gear requirement. Also ML Rin don't have innate Invincibility/Immortality buff but rather depends on the enemies having them for her to steal which is really rare and situational so she might not even be here but I would be on a stake if I don't put her here.

# Complementary Components:
Ok now that your team has 2 units: Yufine and your buffer slave, what more do you want? Well more buffs always help which I will seperate by order of usefulness as well as more imprints (except speed). Sadly all the other ER imprints are non-buffers so body drag time (I guess I should put a throwaway note listing them here: ![Fallen Cecilia](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/fallen-cecilia), ![Maid Chloe](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/maid-chloe), ![Fighter Maya](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/fighter-maya), ![Angelica](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/angelica), ![Crozet](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crozet)
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_reflect.png)Reflect: (a.k.a Dominiel is 2nd best girl, it's canon now)
#### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/hero/dominiel/small.png)![Dominiel](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/dominiel): Remember me?
> Ok, let's be real, you ain't going to do consistent damage relying on counter with -90% attack so this buff granted by Ice Dominiel (not the Mola eating, crit buffing, oneshotting legend Dodomi but the forgotten Dominiel Nixied) is gonna be the most sure-fire way to get your runs not take 4-6 hours
### ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_counter.png)Counter: ML Rin exclusive steal
> This is such a situational buff it might as well not be on here, basically you search out a counterattack mini-boss, proc it and let ML Rin steal the buff for your raid boss. Seems straight forward enough if it wasn't gated to that 2nd mini-boss fight on the Hell Kark side and in normal raid.
### ![](https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/guardians-blessing.png)Guardians Blessing: Colloquially known as Arky's buff
> Well this one is straight forward enough no? Practically a free 20% attack and crit chance buff, only downside is using the literal best dps Guardian available: **Fluffly Arky**
### List of Offensive buffs: ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cridmg_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cri_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up.png) ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up2.png)
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cridmg_up.png) **Crit damage buff** is only granted by ML Rin to herself so it's pretty irrelevant unless you can find a mob that steals that buff from you for you to steal back or a mob that has it (I can't remember any that has that buff tho, but if you do inform me) ~~Included for consistency sake~~
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_cri_up.png) **Crit rate buff** is granted by a couple of people: ![Furious](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/furious), ![Tywin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/tywin), ![Challenger Dominiel](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/challenger-dominiel), and ofc the buff stealer ![ML Rin](https://epicsevendb.com/hero/crescent-moon-rin) 
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up2.png) **Greater attack buff** granted by Yuna through her EE at a 30% chance
- ![](https://assets.epicsevendb.com/buff/stic_att_up.png) **Attack buff** is one of the most accessible buff in the game, finding one shouldn't be that hard

#TL;DR: Yufine with A LOT of ER (170% is safe) with a [immunity/immortality buffer](#An Invincible/Immortal buffer:) and complentary buffers [(Ice Dominiel is bae)](#Reflect:)
